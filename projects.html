                    Through Buildspace Season 5, I had 6 weeks to create and iterate on a project. Me and my two partners, Jaiden Lee and Anshul Chelapurath, 
                    created CipherAI. CipherAI is an AI assisted interview prep. There are interview questions users can answer and test with our test cases. 
                    The built-in AI can give hints, ask follow-up interview questions, and suggest different problems depending on what the user struggles with.

                    <h2>Custom Built Keyboard | 2024</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After months of researching and tired of my 20 dollar keyboard, I sought to build my own keyboard. My keyboard uses the Keychron Q2 Max chasis, 
                    the Iqunix Moonstone Turbo 45g linear switches, and Winterglow Eve keycaps from Osume. In addition, I also modded the keyboard with the 
                    force-break mod, tempest tape mod, and switched out the stock stablizers with Durock stabilizers. Click on the image on the left to open a photo gallery 
                    or click the title to view the build video on Youtube (the recording unfortunately makes the keyboard sound a lot clackier than real life).

                <h2>Image RGB Change of Basis | 2024</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Dr. Haiyu Zou showing me applications of spectural decomposition in image compression in my 
                    MATH 1564 Honors Liner Algebra course, I decided to create a change of basis program for images using Python. 
                    This program can take any number of colors in the RGB color space to change the color basis to something other than 
                    red, green, and blue. The program will take in a set of RGB vectors and get rid of any vectors that creates a 
                    cross product of 0 with any other vector such that the set of vectors left over are all non collinear and have a 
                    magnitude greater than 0 which creates the new basis. If the cardinality of the basis is three or more, the image 
                    will stay the same but the color vectors of each pixels would change according to the transition matrix created 
                    from the new color basis. If the cardinality of the basis is less than three, a projection matrix would be created where 
                    every pixel in the image would undergo an orthogonal projection onto the new color subspace which allows for some unique 
                    image filters to be applied and certain details previously unoticable to the human eye to now stand out.

                <p>
                    During my time at Virginia's Summer Resedential Governor's School, I learned the fundamentals of electrical engineering 
                    and breadboard design. I went from designing logic gates with transistors to building clocks, binary counters, and even calculators. 
                    The project I'm most proud of is my four-bit four-function calculator shown in the image on the left. I started off by building 
                    full adders and chaining them together (images 3 and 4 in the gallery) to creating a four-bit four-function calculator (images 1 and 2 in the gallery). 
                    The two buttons on the very right are for selecting one of four modes: bitwise OR, bitwise AND, binary addition, and binary subtraction. 
                    The results are displayed at the top using four green LEDs and if an overflow occurs, the red LED will flash. 
                    Multiple calculators can also be chained together (second image in the gallery). Click on the image of my calculator on the left to view the gallery.

                    A friend and I came up with a fun way to text in secret by inserting random characters in between every letter of our message. 
                    Manually encrypting and decrypting was a huge pain so I created a program in Java that uses string indexing and concatnation to encrypt
