                <h2>Hosting Immich and Open Media Vault on NAS<span class="justLaunched"> | Just Deployed</span></h2>
                <p>
                    My NAS will be used for two main purposes, media backup and file sharing. The NAS is running Open Media Vault (OMV) for a nice way to monitor 
                    system performance and file systems or partitions. For file sharing, I had set up an SMB server on OMV which allows my PC, laptop, and Android to access 
                    files I constantly access and needs to be synced. For media backup I am using a service called Immich. With Immich, I can manually adjust settings that aren't 
                    accessible in other services like Google Photos. I fine-tuned the backup settings to transcode videos with near lossless compression without taking up significant 
                    network bandwidth to stream videos. Immich also allows me to fine-tune machine learning parameters for facial recognition which works significantly better than 
                    Google Photo's algorithm. In order to manage my NAS on OMV and access Immich remotely, I had bought a domain name and set up Cloudflare Tunnels using 
                    Cloudflare Zero-Trust to gain remote access to my NAS. Thanks to Cloudflare Tunnels, I am able to not only access the server remotely but also generate 
                    sharing links for friends and family who aren't on my Immich instance.

                <h2>Build NAS from Scratch <span class="justLaunched"> | Just Deployed</span></h2>
                <p>
                    In order to cut down on subscriptions and my reliability on cloud service providers, I built a NAS running Ubuntu with Raid 5 from scratch. 
                    The NAS will be running on a Raspberry Pi 5 with a Penta SATA Hat from Radxa with three 2.5" SSDs from Crucial. The NAS currently has 3 Crucial 
                    BX500 2TB SSDs installed for a total capacity of 6TB and 4TB of usable storage with Raid 5. The storage can be expanded to a total of 5 drives 
                    for a total capacity of 10TB and 8TB of usable data. I designed and 3D printed a custom case that improves asthetics, structural integrity, 
                    and allows for easy access to add/replace drives. The top half of the case features a Radxa Penta Sata Hat Top Board that features a small 40mm
                    fan to cool the drives, a small OLED display to show system information, and a button to interact with the NAS and OLED screen. The top half is 
                    fully removable thanks to small magnetic pogo pins I had soldered to the original wires that keep the two halves together magnetically. A simple 
                    Bash script is running as a background service which polls the top board and senses when the top board is disconnected and reconnected in order to 
                    automatically restart the top board service for a seamless user interaction.

                    I competed in the 2024 AI ATL Hackathon with Jaiden Lee and Alison Vu. We had two days to build and deploy our hackathon project. For this hackathon, we created Agiler, an AI powered project management tool 
                    that automatically updates the backlog based off of meeting summaries or recordings. We used a combination of Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude to analyze the backlog, project description, and any 
                    inputs from the meeting recording/summary to create/update tasks and user stories in the backlog. Our tool will automatically link dependencies, estimate difficulty, and prioritize tasks. Our tool effectively 
                    prevents projects from failing by enforcing good project management practices with the help of AI to automate busy-work for project managers. We used React in the frontend and FastAPI with Python in the backend. 
                    We finally used Docker to deploy on GCR.

                <p>
                    After months of researching and tired of my 20 dollar keyboard, I sought to build my own keyboard. My keyboard uses the Keychron Q2 Max chasis, 
                    the Iqunix Moonstone Turbo 45g linear switches, and Winterglow Eve keycaps from Osume. In addition, I also modded the keyboard with the 
                    force-break mod, tempest tape mod, and switched out the stock stablizers with Durock stabilizers. Click on the image on the left to open a photo gallery 
                    or click the title to view the build video on Youtube (the recording unfortunately makes the keyboard sound a lot clackier than real life).

                <h2>Image RGB Change of Basis | 2024</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Dr. Haiyu Zou showing me applications of spectural decomposition in image compression in my 
                    MATH 1564 Honors Liner Algebra course, I decided to create a change of basis program for images using Python. 
                    This program can take any number of colors in the RGB color space to change the color basis to something other than 
                    red, green, and blue. The program will take in a set of RGB vectors and get rid of any vectors that creates a 
                    cross product of 0 with any other vector such that the set of vectors left over are all non collinear and have a 
                    magnitude greater than 0 which creates the new basis. If the cardinality of the basis is three or more, the image 
                    will stay the same but the color vectors of each pixels would change according to the transition matrix created 
                    from the new color basis. If the cardinality of the basis is less than three, a projection matrix would be created where 
                    every pixel in the image would undergo an orthogonal projection onto the new color subspace which allows for some unique 
                    image filters to be applied and certain details previously unoticable to the human eye to now stand out.

                <h2>Four-bit, Four-function Modular Binary Calculator | 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    During my time at Virginia's Summer Resedential Governor's School, I learned the fundamentals of electrical engineering 
                    and breadboard design. I went from designing logic gates with transistors to building clocks, binary counters, and even calculators. 
                    The project I'm most proud of is my four-bit four-function calculator shown in the image on the left. I started off by building 
                    full adders and chaining them together (images 3 and 4 in the gallery) to creating a four-bit four-function calculator (images 1 and 2 in the gallery). 
                    The two buttons on the very right are for selecting one of four modes: bitwise OR, bitwise AND, binary addition, and binary subtraction. 
                    The results are displayed at the top using four green LEDs and if an overflow occurs, the red LED will flash. 
                    Multiple calculators can also be chained together (second image in the gallery). Click on the image of my calculator on the left to view the gallery.

                <h2>Automated Stock Market Analyzer | 2021 - 2024</span></h2>
                <p>
                    I created a day-trading assistant in Python that used Yahoo Finance's downloadable CSVs to grab historical stock data and send alerts/notifications 
                    whenever certain conditions were met. I used modified versions of this day-trading assistant during investment competitions 
                    through the investment club I ran at my high school.
                    <br><br>
                    2024 Update V2.1 (complete redesign):<br>
                    This updated code now automatically runs at key specific times during active trading hours daily (keeping track of holidays) using Windows Scheduler. This script uses Pyppeteer 
                    in Python to webscrape live market data and records them in a JSON file to keep track of historical data throughout the trading day. In combination with 
                    YFinance API to grab past week closing prices, the script will automatically send different alerts through email to all recipients depending on the conditions met. 
                    The script will record stock data and check conditions for every stock listed in a JSON array.

                <h2>Encoder and Decoder for Texting Between Friends | 2020</h2>
                <p>
                    A friend and I came up with a fun way to text in secret by inserting random characters in between every letter of our message. 
                    Manually encrypting and decrypting was a huge pain so I created a program in Java that uses string indexing and concatnation to encrypt 
                    and decrypt messages easily.

                    I plan on training an AI to recognize military equipment down to the specific model. I will pretrain the AI on War Thunder 
                    game footage and then train it on combat footage. The goal is to have the AI recognize different weapon systems down to its model
                    to enhance situational awareness and reduce blue-on-blue incidents.
