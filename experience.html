                <p>
                    I am happy to be joining MITRE for the Summer of 2025 as a Software Engineering Intern. I am excited to work on cutting edge projects 
                    with federal governments and organizations to solve real world problems our nation and global partners face especially at MITRE, which 
                    focuses on research and development.

                <p>
                    At Experimental Flights, I researched the usage of drones for inventory management in warehouses. We
                    explored the usage of DJI Tello drones controlled by a Raspberry Pi as a central command center. I programmed the Pi
                    and the Tello drones to allow for remote connection and control of the drone through UDP sockets. I created 
                    Python scripts that allowed the drone to carry out basic flight paths, automatically scan barcodes and QR codes, and 
                    allow for manual control with keyboard inputs with a live video feed.

                    At thnkrAI, I helped develop price prediction models with the use of large 
                    language models trained on e-commerce sites such as eBay and Amazon through web scrapers I created with NodeJS. 
                    The model I trained is now deployed in an app available on Shopify. The model can accurately predict market price 
                    with just a product description.

                    I Interned in the Safety Department at Interstate's headquarters in Springfield, Virginia. 
                    I was in charge of several day-to-day tasks and projects including the hiring and firing process and 
                    updating expired vehicle and employee records. Though many of these tasks were meant to be done manually, I wrote Python 
                    scripts to automate my workflow; allowing me to complete projects weeks in advance. I also created an internal tool 
                    that allowed us to access quick data without the need to submit a ticket to the IT department and wait for an SQL query.

                    I researched the usage of convolutional neural networks to diagnose cancers and the effects

                    In order to fundraise for our Technology Student Association's National competition, I hosted a 2-day long

                    elementary and middle schoolers. We successfully raised over $1,000 for our competition and every student 
                    could create any object they wanted in CAD and knew how to use a 3D printer. Click on the JMHS TSA logo to
