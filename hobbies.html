                <h2>PC Building</h2>
                <p>I've been building computers since 2020 and have built over 8 PCs since then. 
                    Almost all computers I build are for clients and they are each individually tailored for the client's budget, aesthetics, and use cases. 
                    In addition to consumer computers, I also build workstations, mini-PCs, and servers. If a client wants to build their own computer and just wants 
                    a parts list, I also create custom parts lists for customers. Reach out on the <span><a href="contact.html">Contacts</a></span> page if you seek computer services.

                <h2>Keyboard Building</h2>
                <p>I've recently gotten into building and modding keyboards. I've built one custom keyboard for myself and heavily modded the keyboard. 
                   Like my PC building services, I'm also open to building custom keyboards or modding them for better acoustic profiles.

                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>As a side hobby, I also do lots of photography when I travel and go out. I love taking landscape photos of architecture and nature, 
                    but I also enjoy macrophotography. Currently, I am using a Samsung S22+ as my main camera but I am looking towards purchasing a DLSR 
                    in the near future to unlock my photography potentials. Linked below is my photography Instagram; feel free to check it out!
